                  Using Synclogic is straightforward and helps prevent mistakes
                  in inventory management. To set it up, follow these steps:
                  <br />
                  <br /><strong></strong>
                  1. Choose a primary product (Master) that defines your actual
                  stock.
                  <br />
                  2. Assign secondary products (Children) that will share the
                  Master‚Äôs inventory.
                  <br />
                  3. Set up custom rules. If a Child product represents a pack or
                  a fraction of the Master, configure a ‚ÄúMaster Ratio‚Äù to adjust
                  the stock accordingly.
                  <br />
                  4. Save your changes and let Synclogic do the rest.

                  A Master is the primary product that defines the synchronised
                  inventory. It acts as the base product on which other products
                  depend. For example, if you sell an individual water bottle and
                  also a pack of six, the actual stock is determined by the
                  individual bottle ‚Äì making it the Master, with the pack being a
                  linked Child.

                  A Child is a product that shares its inventory with the Master.
                  Every time a Child is sold, the Master‚Äôs stock is automatically
                  adjusted. This is ideal for items sold both individually and in
                  packs, or for variations such as different colours or sizes of the
                  same product.

                  2. Select the product that will serve as the Master.
                  <br />
                  3. Add the Child products that will share the Master‚Äôs inventory.
                  <br />
                  4. Configure the ‚ÄúMaster Ratio‚Äù if the Child represents a pack or
                  fraction of the Master.
                  <br />
                  5. Save your changes ‚Äì any stock
                  change in the Master will automatically update the Child
                  products.

                  The Master Ratio defines the relationship between the Master and
                  its Children. It specifies how the inventory should be adjusted
                  when a synchronised product is sold. For example:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  - 1 ratio means one unit is deducted from the Master for each
                  Child sold.
                  <br />
                  - 2 ratio means two units are deducted when a Child
                  representing a pack of two is sold.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This ensures accurate stock management across various product
                  presentations without the need for manual adjustments.
